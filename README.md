## Usage
Clone or download this repo, if you want to rename the Xcode project, do that inside Xcode by clicking on the project and Xcode and typing in a new name.

Then `npm install` and `npm run webpack` will get you started. When you click the play icon in Xcode it will start the react-native packager in a new terminal window. If this annoys you, you can also start it manually beforehand by entering `npm start` in a terminal window of your choice.

Suggestions are welcome. Please open an issue.
